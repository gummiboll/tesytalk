# Tesytalk

Small cli tool/library in/for go to communicate with [tesy](https://tesy.com/) water heaters. Shows power usage, current temperature and other random stuff. You can change the temperature with `--settemp` and reset the power usage calculator with `--resetpow`.

Built because I was bored and happend to find the endpoints to communicate with it hidden in the html output from the water heater.
